# proc^4

**procprocprocproc** (proc^4) is a minimal, procedurally generated VR scene made with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io). Live at https://i3games.github.io/proc-4/.

Why the name "procprocprocproc" ("proc"^4)?

- the environment is a procedurally generated maze
- the textures are procedurally generated shaders
- the sound is procedurally generated
- the monsters and their behaviour is procedurally generated

... all from a common random seed.

Nobody: ...

me: _Should I call it "Poor Man's Sky" instead?_
