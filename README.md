# proc^4

**procprocprocproc** (proc^4) is a minimal, procedurally generated VR scene made with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io). Live at https://i3games.github.io/proc-4/.

"You thought you had made it out. Suddenly you feel a force behind you, pulling you **back** deep into the maze. Can you escape before the monsters get at you?"

Why the name "procprocprocproc"?

* the environment is a procedurally generated maze
* the textures are procedurally generated shaders  
* the sound is procedurally generated
* the pull mechanism and monsters' behaviour are procedures

... all from a common random seed.

Nobody: ...

me: *Should I call it "Poor Man's Sky" instead?*
